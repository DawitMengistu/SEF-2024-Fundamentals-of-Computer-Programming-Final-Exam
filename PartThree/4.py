# Write a program that takes a userâ€™s bank account number as input. The program should first check if the account number is at least 12 digits long.
# If it is not, indicate(print) that the account number is invalid. If the account number is 12 digits or longer,
# check if the last 4 digits of the account number are all zeros. If they are, indicate (print) that the account number is valid. Otherwise,
# indicate(print) that the account number is invalid.
